# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

This crate is pre-1.0. Only the latest version published on
[crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/font-dialog) receives security fixes. Please upgrade before reporting
an issue to confirm it still reproduces.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Do not open a public issue for security vulnerabilities.

Report privately via GitHub's
[Security Advisories](https://github.com/pilgrimagesoftware/font-dialog-rust/security/advisories/new). This
keeps the report confidential until a fix is released.

Include, where possible:

- Affected version(s)
- A minimal reproduction or proof of concept
- Impact (e.g. what an attacker can do, what data or systems are exposed)
- Platform (macOS, Windows, or Linux) and toolkit version, since this crate wraps
  OS-native dialog APIs

You should receive an initial response as soon as possible. If the report is confirmed, we'll work
with you on a fix and coordinate a disclosure timeline before any public advisory is published. Reporters
are credited in the advisory unless they ask to remain anonymous.

## Scope

This policy covers the `font-dialog` Rust crate and its published GitHub Actions workflows. Vulnerabilities
in dependencies (`objc2`, `windows`, `gtk4`, etc.) should be reported upstream; if a dependency issue
affects this crate directly (e.g. no fix available, requires a workaround here), report it here as well.
